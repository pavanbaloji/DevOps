XmlPreprocess.exe is a tool that can be used to preprocess specially annotated XML files making property substitutions much like a code preprocessor. It is useful for deploying XML configuration files like .NET *.config files to a target environment making all necessary environment specific substitutions.

For more information on its use see the samples folder.
